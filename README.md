When I want to use the AngleSharp (https://github.com/AngleSharp/AngleSharp)
with HtmlRenderer (https://github.com/LayoutFarm/HtmlRenderer).


This is an experiment project.
Because I don't want to 'harm' to 'timeline' / 'code'/ 'code style' etc
of the original project (AngleSharp).
So I forked it and start this.

---
Aims:
   1.  Test if this project can be use as a Html parser engine
        of our HtmlRenderer project? 
   2. Test the performanace of the parser, if it really fast 
        to meet our need.
   3. To find/ extract/ and define only essential interfaces that are needed to
       work with the HtmlRenderer.
   
---
Targets:  
    Bridge LIbrary "Radius" that interface 
    the AngleSharp with our HtmlRenderer

---
PLAEASE NOTE THAT:
   I try to preserve the interfaces.
   BUT 
   I may change some the implementation code to meed our style.    
   We still need to compat with .NET20.
   We still need a fast parser that meet dynamic html dom rendering.

Don't worry about coding style. I talk C#, If I don't understand I will ask you.

I try to merge it.

But I will change your code to meed our need too.

Please think of this repo is just a design and playground repo. Quick/ Fast / (and+- dirty)
